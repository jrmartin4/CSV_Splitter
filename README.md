- Was given specific IDs, and program only checks for those.
- Was asked for columns 5, 6, and 11.

Steps to run program:
0. Install Java: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
1. Install Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2. Create a new program by going to File>New>Java Project and name it whatever you want, then click create at the window that pops up
3. File>New>Class and name it "CSV_Splitter"
4. Copy and paste my code in that you can find in this repository
5. Change the file paths listed (sorry I don't know your file system or else I'd do it myself)
6. Run>Run As>Java Application

That should do it. Let me know if you have issues.
